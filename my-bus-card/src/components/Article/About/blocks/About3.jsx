            <h1>My dreams</h1>
<div><p>
    I have some dreams. About one of them I told before. <br/>
My dream is to work in a cozy place, side by side with good people, with whom you can exchange knowledge and experience. Also in the next few years I dream of becoming a senior web developer, or a senior full stack developer. Also, for the future, there is a dream to build your own house with a pool, or better with two and get a dog, but that's a completely different story =)

<h2>My day</h2>
 <div>
{/*<p>And the last thing I want to tell you about myself is how my day goes.
When I worked as a shop assistant, my day started at 8 am or 10 am. I woke up, went to breakfast (not always), went to the shower and was about to go to work. After that comes a 9-hour - 12-hour working day, after which I drove home or meet friends. And then I went to bed. But in the meantime, everyone managed to go to the gym, for which after I had no time left with regret.</p>
<p>Now my day can start at 9 am or maybe 11 am. The first thing I do is go to breakfast. Then I try to collect my thoughts for another 20 minutes, wash my face and go for a walk. After I return, I eat something and sit down to study. I watch video tutorials, read the documentation, try to do something interesting in order to get more experience in programming. So the evening is slowly creeping in. In the evening I go for a walk with my love, we walk up to 12 pm, and sometimes up to 2 am. Then my day ends with a movie or a couple of TV series.</p> */}

<p>So how do I see my front-end developer day? <br/>
I wake up at 8 am, go to breakfast, while reading about the latest news in the IT world, drive to work, looking at something interesting for me on the way for entertainment purposes. Upon arrival at work, I sit down at my computer and continue working on an interesting project in a friendly and helpful team, while learning something new along the way. At the end of the working day, I go home, have dinner and still go for a walk with my love. Then I return home and watch something interesting, maybe a video on YouTube, maybe some movie that I wanted to watch for a long time, maybe a series of a series that someone from my acquaintances recommended to me.
